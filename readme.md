# Chaty
The app has been built on the idea of the IRC service, that you can chat with group of people just using the relay you send and the server relay to any one with you in the room.
As I hope to call the app the “big S”

- Secure

  Provide the security you want to have, Chaty doesn’t store any messages in the room,
  so you don’t have to worry on your info and chats you send and receive.
- Speed

  Faster and speed communication as we don’t make a lot of overhead on the client nor
  on the server side, which ‘ll make you send and receive on the fly.
- Simple

  As you can see from the moment you open the app the simplicity of the design and
  implementation makes the user interacts with the app easily and faster without too
  much complicated stuff and also gives you the ability to add more stuff and
  functionality to the app easily as the project structure built essentially on that.
